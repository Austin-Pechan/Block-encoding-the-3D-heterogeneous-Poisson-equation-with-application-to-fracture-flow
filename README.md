This codebase supports the numerical and visual results presented in the paper, including:
  Empirical scaling of the effective condition number for discretized 3D Poisson matrices
  Visualization of multiscale fracture networks and their impact on matrix structure
  Error scaling studies for quantum linear system solvers
  Block encoding complexity analysis for structured matrices
The simulations focus on groundwater flow through geologic fracture networks, modeled via discretized heterogeneous elliptic PDEs.
